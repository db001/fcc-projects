    <p><ol>
          <li> I can see a &#60main&#62 element with a corresponding id="main-doc", which contains the page's main content (technical documentation).
          </li>
    <li> Within the #main-doc ( &#60main&#62 ) element, I can see several &#60section&#62 elements, each with a class of "main-section". There should be a minimum of 5.
    </li>
    <li> The first element within each .main-section should be a &#60header&#62 element which contains text that describes the topic of that section.
    </li>
    <li> Each &#60section&#62 element with the class of "main-section" should also have an id that corresponds with the text of each &#60header&#62 contained within it. Any spaces should be replaced with underscores (e.g. The &#60section&#62 that contains the header "Javascript and Java" should have a corresponding id="Javascript_and_Java").
    </li>
    <li> The .main-section elements should contain at least 10 &#60p&#62 elements total (not each).
    </li>
    <li> The .main-section elements should contain at least 5 &#60code&#62 elements total (not each).
    </li>
    <li> The .main-section elements should contain at least 5 &#60li&#62 items total (not each).
    </li>
    <li> I can see a &#60nav&#62 element with a corresponding id="navbar".
    </li>
    <li> The first element within the navbar should be a &#60header&#62 which contains text that describes the topic of the technical documentation.
    </li>
    <li> Additionally, the navbar should contain link (&#60a&#62) elements with the class of "nav-link". There should be one for every element with the class "main-section".
    </li>
    <li> Each element with the class of "nav-link" should contain text that corresponds to the &#60header&#62 text within each &#60section&#62 (e.g. if you have a "Hello world" section/header, your navbar should have an element which contains the text "Hello world").
    </li>
    <li> When I click on a navbar element, the page should navigate to the corresponding section of the "main-doc" element (e.g. If I click on a "nav-link" element that contains the text "Hello world", the page navigates to a &#60section&#62 element that has that id and contains the corresponding &#60header&#62.
      </li>
    </p>
